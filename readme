steps
1)Download terraform and extract it.
2)copy the extracted folder into required folder.
3)Add terraform path to the system variable
4)verify installation uing command "terraform -version"
5)Before working with aws best practice is to create system variable for access token and secret key instead of using directlt in code.
6)Uncomment the required portion and try running it.


terraform init // will install all the plugins and file required by provider
terraform plan  // will show the action code is going to perform
terraform action // apply the action
